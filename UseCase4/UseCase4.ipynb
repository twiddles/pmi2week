    "# Use Case: Aspect Term Exctractor\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "Companies that provide services or products to their customers would like to know which aspects of their products are relevant to their customers. This knowledge will help to improve their products in the future. Are people talking mostly about the quality of the food, the price of an item or the battery life of a computer? All those terms are what we call \"aspect terms\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This task can be solved using an Aspect Term Extractor. An ATE is a model that extracts the aspect terms from a review, i.e. for each word of one review, your model should predict if the word is an aspect term or not. Terms may consist of multiple words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Notes\n",
    "This notebook addresses the following 3 topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The features extraction process: What is the intuition behind your method, which features are the most important.\n",
    "- The algorithm you selected (we ask you to explore at least 2 different algorithms)\n",
    "- The metric that you used for quantifying the performance of your model\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the term 'predict' and 'extract' interchangably.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "In the process of creating this notebook, the following libraries were used:\n",

    "- The baseline model of predicting the most common term has a very bad performance (~0.013 F1).\n",
    "- The model based approaches significantly out-performs the most_common baseline and the keyword-based approach as measured on the test set.\n",
    "- The Spacy model has the highest recall, but a very low precision. In practice, this would manifest itself with a high rate of false alarms (quantity is good, quality not so much).\n",
    "- The Spacy approach is even weaker than the naive keywords-based approach.\n",
    "- Combining the the model-based approach together with the keywords did not give a boost as expected. F1 performance dropped, with only a small improvement in recall\n",

    "- Better tokenization and sanitization of input\n",
